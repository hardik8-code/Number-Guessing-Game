## Project Description
This **Number Guessing Game** is a console-based game built with **JavaScript** using Node.js. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 and asks the player to guess it. The player has a maximum number of attempts (10 attempts by default) to guess the correct number.

If the player's guess is too high or too low, the game will give a hint and ask them to try again. If the player guesses the number within the allowed number of attempts, they win; otherwise, they lose, and the correct number is revealed.

## Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- User input validation (only numbers between 1 and 100 are accepted).
- Player is given a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the number.
- Feedback is provided after each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
- The game ends when the correct number is guessed or the player runs out of attempts.
